			<p>I like to spend my free time riding horses and roping. I rodeo every chance i get! (2010 - Present)</p>

				<li>I have 6 horses and 4 cows. My horses names are Rooster, Spirit, Lucky, Shorty, Arnold, and Cash.</li>
				<li>We don't have names for our cows but we do have a bull named Melvin that we use to breed!</li>

			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>My family has been in the "rodeo" life since i was born. They wanted me to major in AG business but i see enough animals as it is!</p>
			<p>I've been rodeoing since I was born. I competed in my first rodeo when I was 4 years old and I've been doing it ever since.</p>
			<h4>Future Goals</h4>
